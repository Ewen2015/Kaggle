Hi Zilin and Bo,

I have build a python module to simplify the data process as `Conversion.py`. 

We roughly got three parts in this competion as following:

1. Data: (1) data proccess, (2) exploratory data analysis, (3) feature engineering. 
2. Algorithm: hyper parameter tuning.
3. Improvement: stacking and more.

Hi Zilin,

Please check out the following files, 

1. eda_cvr_ewen.ipynb: exploratory data analysis
2. fe_cvr_ewen.ipynb: feature engineering
3. mt_cvr_ewen.ipynb: modeling and hyper paramter tuning

**Task of the week:** 

- 1. Make sure you download all packages used in the code and run the ipython files successfully. 
- 2. Established new files to record your findings. Files should be ended with `_YOURNAME`. 
- 3. Try to find a way to deal with the `object` variable. There are 26 features, int 19, float 4, and object 3.
